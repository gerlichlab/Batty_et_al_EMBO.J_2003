## Batty et al, 2023; Cohesin-mediated DNA loop extrusion resolves sister chromatids in G2 phase

This repository contains Ipython notebooks and Fiji scripts used to analyse the data generated in the Batty et al publication.

## Fig. 1 - Cohesin resolves sister chromatids in G2 phase.

### (d)

Analysis of the amount of sister chromatid separation in prometaphase HeLa Kyoto cells, in wild type, SMC4 depleted, or NIPBL depleted backgrounds, when either one or two-sister chromatids are labelled with the nucleotide analogue F-ara-EdU.

The notebook calculates the Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC) between F-ara-EdU labelled DNA and bulk DNA stained by Hoechst 33342, for a subset of Z-sections around the centre of the 3D stack. The output is the mean SCC per cell. The notebook can be found here: [notebook]().

### (e)
Analysis of the amount of sister chromatid separation in HeLa Kyoto cells synchronised to G2 phase by RO-3306, in wild type, SMC4 depleted, or NIPBL depleted backgrounds, when either one or two-sister chromatids are labelled with the nucleotide analogue F-ara-EdU.

The notebook calculates the Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC) between F-ara-EdU labelled DNA and bulk DNA stained by Hoechst 33342, for a subset of Z-sections around the centre of the 3D stack. The output is the mean SCC per cell. . The notebook can be found here: [notebook]().

## Preprocessing

The preprocessing of scsHi-C experiments was carried out using the scsHi-C pipeline. The [scshic_pipeline](https://github.com/gerlichlab/scshic_pipeline) was applied to raw sequencing data.
